## Task

A student should develop an application using the selected programming language and graphical API that:

- Displays three-dimensional scene with three-dimensional objects;
- demonstrates all possible scene transformations;
- allows the user to interact with the scene.

## Progress

All possible scene transformations

- [x] Translation
- [x] Rotation
- [x] Scaling

Three-dimensional objects on the scene

- Sphere
- Torus
- Cylinder

Allows the user to interact with the scene.

- Keyboard (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Up Arrow, Down Arrow, +, -)
- Mouse (left click dragging, right click dragging, scrolling in, scrolling out, clicking)
- Gestures (on mobile phone)
